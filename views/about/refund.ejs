  <h1>Refund Policy for SERVEWISE INDIA</h1>
  <p>
    At SERVEWISE INDIA, we are committed to providing exceptional services and
    ensuring your complete satisfaction. We consistently aim to deliver
    high-quality accounting, financial, and secretarial services through our
    platform. If our services do not meet your expectations, please get in touch
    with us right away, and we will strive to resolve your concerns, issue a
    refund, or provide credit for future orders with SERVEWISE INDIA.
  </p>
  <h3>We Want to Hear From You!</h3>
  <p>
    Should you be unhappy with our service, please log in to the BGB Platform
    using the email address linked to your payment. If you’ve forgotten your
    password, you can easily reset it using the “forgot password” option.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you’re logged in, select the engagement that fell short of your
    expectations and indicate your dissatisfaction. We will promptly escalate
    your issue to the relevant Agent and Manager to ensure a quick resolution.
    While we can manage our internal delays, we cannot influence delays caused
    by government processes or issues stemming from incomplete or incorrect
    documentation provided by you. We appreciate your understanding as our team
    works hard to finalize your engagement effectively.
  </p>
  <h3>30-Day Window for Refunds</h3>
  <p>
    You may submit a refund request within 30 days of your payment. However,
    please understand that SERVEWISE INDIA Private Limited considers its service
    responsibilities fulfilled once access to our platform is provided. The
    client is fully responsible for any subsequent actions and the eventual
    results of the service.
  </p>
  <p>Refunds will incur a cancellation fee of 20%.</p>
  <h4>Changing Your Service Order</h4>
  <p>
    If you wish to modify the service you ordered for a different one, you may
    do so within 7 days of your payment.
  </p>
  <h4>How to Submit a Refund Request</h4>
  <p>
    To request a refund, please log in to BGB and select the Get Help option.
    Additionally, send an email to support@weserveyou.online with your
    transaction details to initiate the refund process. Typically, refunds are
    processed within 3 to 5 weeks after we receive all required information.
  </p>
  <h3>Client Liability for Taxes and Penalties</h3>
  <p>
    Once access to the platform is granted, SERVEWISE INDIA considers its
    service obligations complete. The client is solely responsible for ensuring
    the accuracy and completeness of any data submitted. SERVEWISE INDIA will
    not be liable for any penalties, taxes, or additional costs incurred by the
    client during or after the service. We do not accept responsibility for the
    results or any further expenses related to the services provided.
  </p>
  <h3>Factors Beyond Our Control</h3>
  <p>
    We cannot promise specific outcomes or results for our services due to
    external factors that are outside our control. For instance, government
    agencies may deny applications (like trademark filings) for reasons
    unrelated to SERVEWISE INDIA's service. Delays may also arise from
    government backlogs or problems with official platforms (such as MCA, Income
    Tax, or FSSAI websites), which are beyond our management.
  </p>
  <p>
    Services rendered by Associates on the Nearest.Expert platform, who are not
    affiliated with SERVEWISE INDIA, are also not covered by our guarantee or
    refund policy. Any delays or complications caused by government or external
    entities cannot serve as grounds for a refund request.
  </p>
  <h3>Force Majeure Clause</h3>
  <p>
    SERVEWISE INDIA shall not be held accountable for any delays or
    interruptions in service that result from circumstances beyond our control.
    Such circumstances include natural disasters, pandemics, governmental
    actions, wars, acts of terrorism, labor strikes, and other unforeseen
    events. In these cases, SERVEWISE INDIA will not be liable for any delays or
    failure to fulfill its obligations.
  </p>
  <p>
    This revised version aims to clarify the terms, structure, and necessary
    details regarding cancellation fees and GST/CCA charges for refunds, all
    while maintaining a professional and customer-focused tone.
