    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>
      At SERVEWISE INDIA, we are committed to providing exceptional services and
      ensuring your complete satisfaction. We consistently aim to deliver
      high-quality accounting, financial, and secretarial services through our
      platform. If our services do not meet your expectations, please get in
      touch with us right away, and we will strive to resolve your concerns,
      issue a refund, or provide credit for future orders with SERVEWISE INDIA.
    </p>
    <h3>1. We Want to Hear From You!</h3>
    <p>
      Should you be unhappy with our service, please log in to the BGB Platform
      using the email address linked to your payment. If you’ve forgotten your
      password, you can easily reset it using the “forgot password” option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’re logged in, select the engagement that fell short of your
      expectations and indicate your dissatisfaction. We will promptly escalate
      your issue to the relevant Agent and Manager to ensure a quick resolution.
      While we can manage our internal delays, we cannot influence delays caused
      by government processes or issues stemming from incomplete or incorrect
      documentation provided by you. We appreciate your understanding as our
      team works hard to finalize your engagement effectively.
    </p>
    <h3>2. 30-Day Window for Refunds</h3>
    <p>
      You may submit a refund request within 30 days of your payment. However,
      please understand that SERVEWISE INDIA Private Limited considers its
      service responsibilities fulfilled once access to our platform is
      provided. The client is fully responsible for any subsequent actions and
      the eventual results of the service.
    </p>
    <p>Refunds will incur a cancellation fee of 20%.</p>
    <h4>a. Changing Your Service Order</h4>
    <p>
      If you wish to modify the service you ordered for a different one, you may
      do so within 7 days of your payment.
    </p>
    <h4>b. How to Submit a Refund Request</h4>
    <p>
      To request a refund, please log in to BGB and select the Get Help option.
      Additionally, send an email to support@weserveyou.online with your
      transaction details to initiate the refund process. Typically, refunds are
      processed within 3 to 5 weeks after we receive all required information.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Client Liability for Taxes and Penalties</h3>
    <p>
      Once access to the platform is granted, SERVEWISE INDIA considers its
      service obligations complete. The client is solely responsible for
      ensuring the accuracy and completeness of any data submitted. SERVEWISE
      INDIA will not be liable for any penalties, taxes, or additional costs
      incurred by the client during or after the service. We do not accept
      responsibility for the results or any further expenses related to the
      services provided.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Factors Beyond Our Control</h3>
    <p>
      We cannot promise specific outcomes or results for our services due to
      external factors that are outside our control. For instance, government
      agencies may deny applications (like trademark filings) for reasons
      unrelated to SERVEWISE INDIA's service. Delays may also arise from
      government backlogs or problems with official platforms (such as MCA,
      Income Tax, or FSSAI websites), which are beyond our management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Services rendered by Associates on the Nearest.Expert platform, who are
      not affiliated with SERVEWISE INDIA, are also not covered by our guarantee
      or refund policy. Any delays or complications caused by government or
      external entities cannot serve as grounds for a refund request.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Force Majeure Clause</h3>
    <p>
      SERVEWISE INDIA shall not be held accountable for any delays or
      interruptions in service that result from circumstances beyond our
      control. Such circumstances include natural disasters, pandemics,
      governmental actions, wars, acts of terrorism, labor strikes, and other
      unforeseen events. In these cases, SERVEWISE INDIA will not be liable for
      any delays or failure to fulfill its obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This revised version aims to clarify the terms, structure, and necessary
      details regarding cancellation fees and GST/CCA charges for refunds, all
      while maintaining a professional and customer-focused tone.
