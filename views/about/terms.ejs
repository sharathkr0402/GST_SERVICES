        <li>To comply with legal obligations or legal processes.</li>

          other individuals.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        BGB limits the collection and use of Customer Information on a

        shared with third parties, including affiliates, vendors, and partners,
        under appropriate confidentiality agreements and legal requirements.

      <h5>Storage and Transfer of Customer Information</h5>
      BGB follows applicable laws regarding the storage and transfer of Customer
      Information. In some cases, Customer Information may be stored or
      processed in countries other than your location due to server locations or
      service provider agreements. We ensure that such transfers are protected
      by appropriate confidentiality measures.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Retention of Customer Information</h5>
      <p>
        BGB retains Customer Information as long as necessary to provide you
        with our Services, manage your account, comply with legal obligations,
        or for legal defense.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also retain Customer Information for business purposes such as fraud
        prevention, responding to queries, or fulfilling contractual
        obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once retention is no longer necessary, BGB makes every effort to
        securely delete or destroy the Customer Information as per our internal
        policies.

    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Security of Customer Information</h5>

        BGB takes appropriate measures to secure Customer Information from
        unauthorized access, including encrypted transmission.

      <p>
        Customers are advised to select strong passwords and safeguard their
        credentials. A strong password should include letters, numbers, and
        special characters, and it should not be shared with anyone.

    orders with SERVEWISE INDIA.
  </p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <h5>Not Happy? Reach Out!</h5>
      If youâ€™re not satisfied with our service, simply log into the iCFO Portal
      and submit a ticket for the relevant engagement to start the refund
      process. All support requests are reviewed by our Senior Management and
      will receive a personal response within 24-48 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Refund Guidelines</h5>
      The service obligation of SERVEWISE INDIA Private Limited is deemed
      fulfilled once you gain access to our platform. All subsequent
      responsibilities, including the final results of the service, rest solely
      with the client. It is essential for clients to ensure the accuracy of the
      information provided. Consequently, SERVEWISE INDIA will not cover any
      penalties or taxes incurred by clients. Furthermore, SERVEWISE INDIA is
      not liable for any additional costs incurred by clients in relation to the
      service's completion or its outcomes. A cancellation charge of 20% will
      apply to all refunds.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>How to Request a Refund</h5>
      You can initiate a refund request through the iCFO Platform after logging
      in. To request a refund, please post your request in the relevant chat
      room addressed to the engagement manager. All refund requests must be
      submitted within 60 days of purchase. Requests made after 60 days will not
      be accepted, and only credit will be available for service completion or
      changes. We will aim to process your refund request within 4 to 5 weeks of
      receiving all required information, including the reason for the refund
      and bank details.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Service Modification</h5>
      If you wish to modify the service you ordered for a different one, you
      must submit this request within 7 days of the purchase date.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Standard Pricing Policy</h5>
      SERVEWISE INDIA adheres to a standard pricing model that does not impose
      additional service fees under any circumstances. However, this standard
      pricing does not apply if the total fee paid by the client increases due
      to government fee adjustments or costs incurred for completing legal
      documentation or re-filing forms with the government due to rejections or
      resubmissions. SERVEWISE INDIA is not responsible for any other costs
      incurred by clients related to service completion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Uncontrollable Factors</h5>
      We cannot guarantee specific results or outcomes for your procedures. For
      example, a trademark application might be rejected by the government for
      legal reasons beyond SERVEWISE INDIAâ€™s control. Additionally, delays due
      to government backlogs or issues with platforms like MCA, Income Tax, or
      FSSAI websites can extend processing times. Similarly, SERVEWISE INDIA
      does not assure outcomes from services provided by Associates on the
      Nearest.Expert platform, as they are not employees of SERVEWISE INDIA.
      Such issues are beyond our control and are not eligible for refunds.
      Therefore, any delays caused by government processing cannot justify a
      refund.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Force Majeure Clause</h5>
      SERVEWISE INDIA will not be held in violation of its Satisfaction
      Guarantee or any service terms, nor liable to the Client for any
      interruption, delay, or cessation of service obligations due to events
      such as earthquakes, floods, fires, storms, droughts, landslides,
      hurricanes, epidemics, acts of God, public disturbances, changes in law,
      wars, terrorism, labor strikes, and other unforeseen events beyond our
      control (collectively referred to as "Force Majeure Events").
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Cancellation Charges</h5>
      Since we incur costs and allocate time, manpower, technology, and effort
      for your service or document preparation, our guarantee only covers
      satisfaction issues stemming from SERVEWISE INDIA's actions, not personal
      changes in your circumstances or mindset. If you need us to pause the
      processing of a service, we will retain the fee paid in your account until
      you are ready to resume the service.
